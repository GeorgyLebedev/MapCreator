# mapcreator
MapCreator is an application for creating cartographic diagrams in a graphic editor. The graphic editor provides a variety of tools such a cursor, brush, paths, shapes, icons, and text. You can draw a map on the canvas and save it in a database to return to editing it later at any time. The unique feature of the application is that any object placed on the canvas can be modified at any time. If desired, each map can be saved in multiple graphic formats.
